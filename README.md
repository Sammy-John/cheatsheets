# Cheatsheet

A lightweight, interactive  cheatsheet designed as a quick reference tool while coding.

This project generates draggable "post-it" style reference cards directly from JSON data, allowing you to filter by topic or category and freely arrange the cards for your own workflow. Cards can be moved anywhere on the screen and snapping to a grid ensures neat alignment.

The cheatsheet is intended to be used side-by-side with your development environment — ideal for learning, practicing, or quick lookups.

## ✨ Features

- Freely draggable and positionable reference cards (desktop only).
- Snap-to-grid placement for easy organization.
- Toggle visibility of topics, categories, and individual cards.
- Filter system with a responsive sidebar.
- Fully responsive design (dragging disabled on mobile).
- Automatically generated from JSON — easy to expand with more topics and cards.
